# Welcome to Apparate

Apparate is a namespace created by [chrisnharvey](https://github.com/chrisnharvey), a developer from the UK.

## Why?

The idea behind Apparate is to have a brand behind the software we release, instead of releasing it under our own namespace, we have a single, memorable and easy to type namespace.

Apparate isn't just a place for me to release the software I create, Apparate is a place for any developer to release the cool things they've been working on. 

## How do I add my software?

To list your software here, there are a few soft guidelines that should be followed (but aren't required).

* Released under an OSI or FSF approved license.
* Have tests
* Use semantic versioning
* Keep a changelog
* Use a CI service to automatically run tests
* Have a kickass readme and/or documentation

Open an issue on this Github repo, starting the issue title with "[Listing Request]", describing your project and the reasons why your software should be listed.
